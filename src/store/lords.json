For decades, Arkhan remained staunchly loyal to Nagash; a great warrior and general, he was also an accomplished student of dark sorcery thanks to his master's teachings. After fifty years of rule, the other cities of Nehekhara revolted against Nagash – desperate to end his malicious reign. The Army of the Seven Kings besieged Khemri, and Nagash was forced to retreat. Arkhan held back the allied Priest Kings’ legions through feats both martial and arcane. He finally fell, not to some hero’s blade but an ordinary spear thrown by a nameless soldier. By his dying breath he cursed both the spear and any that desecrated his corpse."

In an age of comets and new empires, Nagash remains adrift from the world… for the moment. But he is very much active. Arkhan's Black Tower a beacon for those who worship the Arch-Necromancer as a god-in-waiting. Naturally, his greatest rival – everyone's greatest rival no less – is Settra the Imperishable. The two have fought dozens of times; although Arkhan’s forces cannot rival Settra’s legions, neither can the Imperishable overcome the Liche King’s dark sorcery. Thus, their wars end in stalemate, and only when Arkhan utters false promises of fealty does Settra return satisfied to Khemri. Such false servitude cannot – will not – last, for while there is still a chance to resurrect Nagash, his loyal servant will take it."

As Khalida lay dying, Neferata let her own cursed blood infect the Lybaran queen, as a final, spiteful act. The Warrior-Queen cried to the gods in desperation, and one answered! The Asp-Goddess heard Khalida's pleas and purged the taint from her veins, at the cost of her life. Khalida’s body was borne back to Lybaras in sorrow, where she was embalmed and placed upon her throne, ready to defend her city and godly patron from behind the wall of death."

However, when Lybaras is threatened, Khalida acts, and quickly. At Asaph's bidding, she silently rises from her throne and commands her loyal legions to march forth. Khalida fights not merely out of loyalty to the goddess who aided her, she harbours a deep, eternal loathing – not just for her cousin, but all Vampires who dare cross her path."

It was Khatep who tended to Settra’s dying mortal form and promised the Great King that he would rise again on the Day of Awakening. As the years past, the hieratic cult’s quest for lore was partially successful. The priests themselves learnt how to sustain a form of Unlife, their spirits tethered to their desiccated bodies, yet the knowledge to bring back the kings as eternal demi-gods still lay beyond their grasp. However, they were undeterred and their search continued, all while serving their living kings as advisors and viziers. Thus, the Mortuary Cult spread across Nehekhara."

For decades, Arkhan remained staunchly loyal to Nagash; a great warrior and general, he was also an accomplished student of dark sorcery thanks to his master's teachings. After fifty years of rule, the other cities of Nehekhara revolted against Nagash – desperate to end his malicious reign. The Army of the Seven Kings besieged Khemri, and Nagash was forced to retreat. Arkhan held back the allied Priest Kings’ legions through feats both martial and arcane. He finally fell, not to some hero’s blade but an ordinary spear thrown by a nameless soldier. By his dying breath he cursed both the spear and any that desecrated his corpse."

In an age of comets and new empires, Nagash remains adrift from the world… for the moment. But he is very much active. Arkhan's Black Tower a beacon for those who worship the Arch-Necromancer as a god-in-waiting. Naturally, his greatest rival – everyone's greatest rival no less – is Settra the Imperishable. The two have fought dozens of times; although Arkhan’s forces cannot rival Settra’s legions, neither can the Imperishable overcome the Liche King’s dark sorcery. Thus, their wars end in stalemate, and only when Arkhan utters false promises of fealty does Settra return satisfied to Khemri. Such false servitude cannot – will not – last, for while there is still a chance to resurrect Nagash, his loyal servant will take it."

In secret, she stole the forbidden lore of Nagash to recreate the Elixir of Life. But Neferata’s own concoction was flawed – it did indeed extend her life, but the cost was an unyielding thirst for blood. Neferata had unwittingly created a race that would blight all the world forever more, she became the first Vampire."

As Khalida lay dying, Neferata let her own cursed blood infect the Lybaran queen, as a final, spiteful act. The Warrior-Queen cried to the gods in desperation, and one answered! The Asp-Goddess heard Khalida's pleas and purged the taint from her veins, at the cost of her life. Khalida’s body was borne back to Lybaras in sorrow, where she was embalmed and placed upon her throne, ready to defend her city and godly patron from behind the wall of death."

Khalida fights not merely out of loyalty to the goddess who aided her, she harbours a deep, eternal loathing – not just for her cousin, but all Vampires who dare cross her path."

It was Khatep who tended to Settra’s dying mortal form and promised the Great King that he would rise again on the Day of Awakening. As the years past, the hieratic cult’s quest for lore was partially successful. The priests themselves learnt how to sustain a form of Unlife, their spirits tethered to their desiccated bodies, yet the knowledge to bring back the kings as eternal demi-gods still lay beyond their grasp. However, they were undeterred and their search continued, all while serving their living kings as advisors and viziers. Thus, the Mortuary Cult spread across Nehekhara."

But the curse of man, compared to Dwarfs and Elves, is their fleeting existence. Soon the kings and princes of the city-states became obsessed with death, with extending their meagre span. The Mortuary Cult was formed during Settra’s reign and charged with ensuring that mortal bonds would not halt his rule. Settra passed with a curse upon his lips, buried in a grand chamber beneath his mighty pyramid to await the Day of Awakening, when the Mortuary Cult will fulfil their promise and Settra will rise to rule Khemri and dominate all the kingdoms along the Great River Vitae once again. Only modest progress in extending life was made until the rise of Nagash, for it was he who was destined to become the first and greatest of all Necromancers – he who truly brought Unlife to the world."

He cast a great ritual and all the dead in the city-states rose from their ageless slumbers. But this was not the glorious Day of Awakening promised by the Mortuary Cult. The kings awoke entombed in their sarcophagi, breaking free of their burial chambers they saw through empty eye sockets. They had not woken as gods, but were still the rotting mummies that had withered inside their tombs for countless centuries. Some went insane, others remain in denial, but a few were filled with rage at this betrayal. None more so than Settra."

In those days there were many Dark Elves still hiding in Ulthuan, and Alith Anar took to eradicating them with a vengeance. Foes not killed in battle were crucified on trees or had their skin stretched across the ragged cliff-faces, where those who passed could witness the insurgents' grisly fate. As Anar attacked and burned each enemy encampment, his infamy grew. He and his loyal warriors struck from the darkness to purge their homeland of traitors and those sympathetic to Malekith. And so the Legend of the Shadow King grew. "

Her power drawn from the hearts of all Asur, she is anathema to creatures of fell spirit, and no one can speak falsehood in her presence.

Foes not killed in battle were crucified on trees or had their skin stretched across the ragged cliff-faces, where those who passed could witness the insurgents' grisly fate. As Anar attacked and burned each enemy encampment, his infamy grew. He and his loyal warriors struck from the darkness to purge their homeland of traitors and those sympathetic to Malekith.

Having been cast out by her Norscan tribe as a baby, she is said to have cut off her own fishtail before heading out to sea to seek her fortune, biding her time until she was strong enough – in every sense – to take her bloody revenge upon the people who left her for dead."

Aranessa knows that it is her duty to protect the Seafather’s realm as he protects her, but the sea is vast, and such a task would take countless lifetimes, so Manann has granted her some of the world’s most powerful seafarers – Vampire Admirals, with whom he has made pacts in exchange for their aid. Aranessa is not entirely comfortable with this alliance, but knows her Necromantic officers are undeniably useful. As Manann washes the corpses of dead sailors against the Swordfysh’s hull and upon the shores of Sartosa, her allies breathe Unlife into them, thus fortifying her crew with shipmates Manann considers more ‘permanent’."

Only the open seas and the glitter of gems can melt her scowl, but as Aranessa’s crew maintain, on those rare occasions where she deigns to smile it is like a new dawn. But what manner of dawn? A dawn of merciless, cutthroat violence, theft and murder, which rages without end – that sort of dawn. Beholden to no man, be he living or dead, Captain Aranessa Saltspite – the self-styled ‘Pirate Queen’ – is every bit as merciless as the Great Ocean itself!"

Many decades ago, Cylostra was the favourite court singer of Bretonnian royalty, a prima donna of considerable size and with the proverbial ‘artistic temperament’ in spades, who never accepted anything less than having things all her own way.

Amid a gale of truly epic proportions, the Bretonnian galleon went down in a violent electrical storm, drowning everyone on board, but as the legend goes, Cylostra had already usurped the ship’s meek captain before it sank, simply for daring to delay her performance by attempting to circumvent the dangerous weather! In a fit of rage, and demonstrating a near-unnatural physical strength born of her passion for music, she threw him overboard in what was, up to that point in her life, an uncharacteristic act of cold-blooded murder. Ordering the subjugated crew to keep the ship on course directly into the storm, Cylostra’s delusions of grandeur even made her believe that she could demand safe passage from the tempest itself by singing determinedly over the howling gales. Sadly, for her, the elements cannot so easily be tamed. As the Lamprey sank down beneath the waves, her futile, pitch-perfect notes turned to shrill, gurgled screaming."

Those who know the legend of the ‘Siren of the Storm’ flee in terror at the sight of her ghostly, barnacle-strewn galleon, for it is said that when it appears with Cylostra singing upon its bow like a dreadful, Unliving figurehead, her songs of death paralyse all those unfortunate enough to hear them before her Undead crew – whom she refers to rather theatrically as ‘The Drowned’ – appear to drag them down into a watery grave, before they are raised again to join the Madame-Captain’s ratings for a life of unfettered piracy and murder!"

With devotions such as these, you would think that a life of adventure on the perilous high seas of the Great Ocean – endlessly fighting, raiding and plundering, at great personal risk – would be far too much like hard work for the hedonistic Druchii. Yet there are some among their number who eschew the decadent lifestyles of their peers, throwing caution, and themselves, to the wind, quite literally."

Not so in the case of Lokhir Fellheart – the dreaded ‘Krakenlord’. He was born to ply the rolling seas, bringing death to those stupid enough to attempt to traverse them, and fire, terror and enslavement to unsuspecting foreign shores. Countless ports and coastal cities lie ruined and ablaze in his wake, for Fellheart is the latest in a long line of doom-bringing admirals to command the Black Ark known as the Tower of the Blessed Dread."

More treasure flows through Karond Kar than ever before – of both the shiny sort and the fleshy, enslaved kind – earning him the grudging respect, if not quite the trust, of the city-port’s Dreadlord masters. But that is enough for Fellheart, for he cares little for politics or anything much except loot and plunder and what it can buy him – the loyalty of his Corsairs and the lavish bribes he pays to insalubrious officials that enable him to operate freely. Although he keeps the best pieces for himself, Fellheart is admired by his crew for his generosity, a quality not normally associated with Dark Elves! They also trust him due to the personal courage he displays in battle, a dangerous habit that other Druchii admirals tend to lose as soon as they can, lest their days on account upon the Great Ocean be very few in number!"

Well aware that the loyalties of pirate crews hold only as long as their captain’s reputation, Fellheart relentlessly slays enemy heroes, tossing their severed heads onto an ever-growing pile, knowing full well that every skull adds another page to the book of his legend and gives mutineers more than a few compelling reasons not to cross swords with their captain!"

The story goes that, while on a fateful quest to further augment his already not-inconsiderable might, Harkon attempted to use his Dark Magic to enter a chamber inside a Lizardman temple buried deep within the deadly Lustrian jungle. Powerful glyphs barred his way, but he pushed onwards in spite of the barriers and driven by his fatal flaw – his great arrogance and hubris - causing the magical seals to retaliate and drain his magical power and then his lifeforce, whilst the walls of the ancient ritual chamber began to crumble. With supreme effort, Harkon managed to break free and stagger outside as the passageway collapsed behind him, but the damage had been done – his connection to the Winds of Magic was severed and his mind was shattered, leaving his personality fractured into a dozen different facets which to this day battle for dominance in his mind."

Although once a member of Sylvania’s aristocratic Vampire dynasty, he had a markedly different vision from his squabbling peers of how he would achieve Necromantic supremacy. After studying the countless charts which map the ebb and flow of magic across the world, von Carstein realised that by mastering the art of seafaring he would be able to harness the magical gales that whirl and cascade across the oceans."

By using the whirlpool’s raw power to draw in the shattered remains of dead warships, he has forged a grotesque seafaring vessel of his own – the Bloody Reaver, an amalgam of rotting galleons and eldritch power upon which sits the dark and jagged crag of his floating castle, standing proudly like a conqueror’s statue!

Having been cast out by her Norscan tribe as a baby, she is said to have cut off her own fishtail before heading out to sea to seek her fortune, biding her time until she was strong enough – in every sense – to take her bloody revenge upon the people who left her for dead."

Aranessa knows that it is her duty to protect the Seafather’s realm as he protects her, but the sea is vast, and such a task would take countless lifetimes, so Manann has granted her some of the world’s most powerful seafarers – Vampire Admirals, with whom he has made pacts in exchange for their aid. Aranessa is not entirely comfortable with this alliance, but knows her Necromantic officers are undeniably useful. As Manann washes the corpses of dead sailors against the Swordfysh’s hull and upon the shores of Sartosa, her allies breathe Unlife into them, thus fortifying her crew with shipmates Manann considers more ‘permanent’."

Only the open seas and the glitter of gems can melt her scowl, but as Aranessa’s crew maintain, on those rare occasions where she deigns to smile it is like a new dawn. But what manner of dawn? A dawn of merciless, cutthroat violence, theft and murder, which rages without end – that sort of dawn. Beholden to no man, be he living or dead, Captain Aranessa Saltspite – the self-styled ‘Pirate Queen’ – is every bit as merciless as the Great Ocean itself!"

In a fit of rage, and demonstrating a near-unnatural physical strength born of her passion for music, she threw him overboard in what was, up to that point in her life, an uncharacteristic act of cold-blooded murder. Ordering the subjugated crew to keep the ship on course directly into the storm, Cylostra’s delusions of grandeur even made her believe that she could demand safe passage from the tempest itself by singing determinedly over the howling gales. Sadly, for her, the elements cannot so easily be tamed. As the Lamprey sank down beneath the waves, her futile, pitch-perfect notes turned to shrill, gurgled screaming."

Those who know the legend of the ‘Siren of the Storm’ flee in terror at the sight of her ghostly, barnacle-strewn galleon, for it is said that when it appears with Cylostra singing upon its bow like a dreadful, Unliving figurehead, her songs of death paralyse all those unfortunate enough to hear them before her Undead crew – whom she refers to rather theatrically as ‘The Drowned’ – appear to drag them down into a watery grave, before they are raised again to join the Madame-Captain’s ratings for a life of unfettered piracy and murder!"

With devotions such as these, you would think that a life of adventure on the perilous high seas of the Great Ocean – endlessly fighting, raiding and plundering, at great personal risk – would be far too much like hard work for the hedonistic Druchii. Yet there are some among their number who eschew the decadent lifestyles of their peers, throwing caution, and themselves, to the wind, quite literally."

Not so in the case of Lokhir Fellheart – the dreaded ‘Krakenlord’. He was born to ply the rolling seas, bringing death to those stupid enough to attempt to traverse them, and fire, terror and enslavement to unsuspecting foreign shores. Countless ports and coastal cities lie ruined and ablaze in his wake, for Fellheart is the latest in a long line of doom-bringing admirals to command the Black Ark known as the Tower of the Blessed Dread."

More treasure flows through Karond Kar than ever before – of both the shiny sort and the fleshy, enslaved kind – earning him the grudging respect, if not quite the trust, of the city-port’s Dreadlord masters. But that is enough for Fellheart, for he cares little for politics or anything much except loot and plunder and what it can buy him – the loyalty of his Corsairs and the lavish bribes he pays to insalubrious officials that enable him to operate freely. Although he keeps the best pieces for himself, Fellheart is admired by his crew for his generosity, a quality not normally associated with Dark Elves! They also trust him due to the personal courage he displays in battle, a dangerous habit that other Druchii admirals tend to lose as soon as they can, lest their days on account upon the Great Ocean be very few in number!"

Well aware that the loyalties of pirate crews hold only as long as their captain’s reputation, Fellheart relentlessly slays enemy heroes, tossing their severed heads onto an ever-growing pile, knowing full well that every skull adds another page to the book of his legend and gives mutineers more than a few compelling reasons not to cross swords with their captain!"

The story goes that, while on a fateful quest to further augment his already not-inconsiderable might, Harkon attempted to use his Dark Magic to enter a chamber inside a Lizardman temple buried deep within the deadly Lustrian jungle. Powerful glyphs barred his way, but he pushed onwards in spite of the barriers and driven by his fatal flaw – his great arrogance and hubris - causing the magical seals to retaliate and drain his magical power and then his lifeforce, whilst the walls of the ancient ritual chamber began to crumble. With supreme effort, Harkon managed to break free and stagger outside as the passageway collapsed behind him, but the damage had been done – his connection to the Winds of Magic was severed and his mind was shattered, leaving his personality fractured into a dozen different facets which to this day battle for dominance in his mind."

Such is his renown, Teclis – the Loremaster of Hoeth and Warden of the White Tower – casts a shadow so lengthy that his influence will be felt right across the world long after his death."

Of all the warm-blooded invaders to trespass on Lustria, it is the Skaven – and Clan Pestilens in particular – that the Lizardmen hate the most. Eventually, after decades of self-imposed exile, the Plague Monks re-joined the Under-Empire and immediately claimed their place on the Council of Thirteen.

While the grand ruler of Clan Mors, Warlord Gnawdwell, takes his seat on the Council of Thirteen in the ratmen capital of Skavenblight, the City of Pillars falls under Gnawdwell’s infamous ‘Right Claw’: Queek Headtaker."

He is despised by Dwarfs for the sheer amounts of heads he has taken, with a record number of entries in the Great Book of Grudges, but he is also hated by Greenskins and Elves too. The only thing more renowned than Queek’s fighting prowess is his arrogance. The Headtaker is a power-hungry narcissist who carries the severed heads of his latest victims upon his trophy rack, advertising to enemies and followers just how truly great he is."

As he walks, worms and insects fester to the surface, rivers travel the wrong way, and fire flits through the air. The Bray-Shamans claim that if the physical body of Morghur is cut down, then his vile spirit is simply reborn elsewhere. To the Gors, he is the essence of Chaos - the collective will of all Beastmen to fight order and burn civilisation to the ground. While the Beastmen venerate this twisted creature, the Uncloven revile him. The only one to perhaps understand the true horror of Morghur is Queen Ariel of the Wood Elves. It is she alone who perceives what the Shadowgave actually represents: a spirit of evil too powerful to be contained within a single corporeal form. Thus war rages between the Asrai and the Beastmen as the Queen seeks a way to destroy Morghur forever. The Master of Skulls knows of this endeavour but is not concerned, yet hates the Wood Elves for all they represent in turn. And as they seek his destruction, Morghur dedicates all his demented thoughts to devising their ruin."

The One-Eye has a deep understanding of his followers, able to channel the unruly nature of the herd and corral his Gors by harnessing their wild nature. Not every true-horn is worthy of Khazrak's retinue; inferior tribes will come, Gors from across the Drakwald, drawn by the One-Eye's dark reputation and hoping to share in his despicable spoils. But Khazrak's success means he can afford to be choosy, and so only those Cloven Ones he deems worthy are offered a place by his side. Those that are turned down may well be sent on their way unmolested, others that Khazrak deems as a threat - perhaps bitter at their rejection - will not leave the immediate area alive. With the One-Eye able to be selective, Khazrak retains a fearsome grip upon his army - a wild force that enacts his cunning and effective plans with murderous efficiency. No one is spared during Khazrak's attacks, his superbly-trained Warhounds easily chasing down the few who manage to escape the warherd's trap."

Sigmar was a warrior in life and a god to fighters upon his ascension, so His clergy follow their Lord’s example - none more so than Volkmar the Grim. He has fought in countless battles, both on and off the War Altar of Sigmar - a mobile shrine of divine power. When Volkmar fights, the men of the Empire are encouraged by the sight that Sigmar’s holy representative smiting His foes in their midst."

In fact it was their alliance that gave Franz the three votes he needed to beat Boris Todbringer’s candidacy, thus suggesting that amidst the fire and wrath there is a shrewdness to Volkmar - something that many in the courts of Altdorf and Middenheim do not give him credit for. However, this has agitated relations between the Cult of Sigmar and Middenland, especially with the Ar-Ulric, the religious leader of Ulric’s cult. Hence, there is a need for a strong Emperor on the throne, someone with a powerful congregation of Sigmar’s chosen at his side."

His love of danger and the open road meant he would make any excuse to deliver messages to Ulfheim or Vassel. One day, he returned from his adventures to find his brothers and father dead in their beds, taken by the ravaging Plague of Blue Roses. Fungus-bruises covered their bodies, and its spores were thick in the air. Ghorst could not accept their loss. At first he tried to embrace his lost brothers, but the plague would not take him - fate had other designs for Helman Ghorst! Eventually he plunged himself into the study of the black arts, hoping to return his brothers to life."

Such ambition, combined with a wilful lack of self-preservation for his own soul, drew the attention of Mannfred von Carstein, another driven by familial bonds, though ones far different in nature. In Ghorst, Mannfred found a willing puppet, a servant whose loyalty he could easily buy; in Mannfred, Ghorst saw a master of Necromantic lore, who could bring his brothers back to full Unlife, if he himself proved worthy."

He saw untold acres of trees felled and the Elves themselves invite countless calamities not only on their race, but on the greater forest realms as well. Now Durthu's patience has gone, replaced by anger and madness. Once a healer, now he is wrathful, making no distinction between the lost, the innocent and the wicked. The Elves are spared the Ancient's anger… for now at least, but he no longer considers them friends, only allies for common cause.

A savage King, he is the vessel of the Elven God, Kurnous, the Hunter. However, Orion's savagery is tempered with the wisdom of Queen Ariel's guidance and that of the countless hosts who choose to take his form each year. Every vernal equinox, a young prince is taken to the Oak of Ages and there fashioned by the Elven Queen into the King's mighty form. With each year that passes, another chosen one is called and another voice added to the choir of personalities that influence Orion. The eldest are now the faintest of whispers, having lived as the King thousands of years hence, while the most recent add their youthful fury to the god-King's will. And yet the 'King in the Wood' persists, continuing to reign throughout the many seasons of his existence. In battle, when his realm  is threatened, Orion is the first to fight in its defence. Taking up his mighty weapons of war, he winds his great horn and calls the Elves of Athel Loren to the Wild Hunt!"

The High King, Thorgrim Grudgebearer, was initially sceptical – Ironhammer’s expedition would not be the first to attempt such a feat. Karak Eight Peaks has notoriously been riddled with foes of all kinds ever since its fall. Currently, a particularly sneaky and cunning Night Goblin 'Warlord' rules the upper levels of Eight Peaks, one who has easily thwarted such quests in the past."

It should be noted, though, that this is his fourth attempt to recapture his Ancestral fortress, to the great shame of all Dawi, living or dead. However, the Ironhammer will not easily be stopped. Finally, after decades spent fostering the support of Guilds and allies, and with the full support of the High King, Belegar gathers Clan Angrund at Karak Izor. Once more a throng of vengeful Dwarfs will set off under Ironhammer’s command, to claim what is rightfully theirs!"

The current duke is the courageous yet stern Alberic, known for his strict adherence to the rules of chivalry and the preservation of the natural order. Knights trained under Alberic are among the very best Bretonnia has to offer, showing almost suicidal levels of bravery on the battlefield – never shrinking from an opponent, no matter their size or reputation. Duke Alberic’s coat of arms bears the distinctive Trident of Manann, the Sea God, who watches over Bordeleaux’s coastlines and vies with the Lady of the Lake for the affections of its people, such is his importance in the region. Certainly, along the sea routes and among sea-borne traders, Manann is considered the more popular patron-god. Legend has it that Alberic’s ancestor, Duke Marcus – one of the original Companions of Gilles the Uniter – himself fought alongside the temperamental sea god; apparently, the pair expelled raiders from Bordeleaux’s coastlines together, restoring peace and allowing trade to flourish once again unhindered."

This means that Alberic has the smallest Ducal household in the Kingdom, but one that is nevertheless a force to be reckoned with and containing some of Bretonnia’s greatest Knights. Unfortunately, circumstance has thus far prevented Alberic from achieving his life’s ambition – to embark upon a Grail Quest. For this to happen, a suitable successor must be found so that Bordeleaux may continue to flourish in his absence. Despite his advancing years, the Duke remains hopeful that a candidate may yet emerge, enabling him to leave his ancestral seat and search for the holy chalice of legend in the Lady’s blessed name!"

Her earthly representative is the Fay Enchantress, who watches over Bretonnia from her tower in Carcassonne and upon whose wise counsel King Louen depends. In fact, during times of dynastic crisis, the Enchantress is empowered to choose the next Royarch from amongst the dukes and has, on at least one prior occasion, stripped a tyrannical or cruel ruler of his throne and commanded his own Knights to forcibly expel the oppressor from the Kingdom! Whilst undoubtedly ancient – some say thousands of years old even – the Enchantress appears to all as a beautiful young woman and is reincarnated instantly as soon as her host body wears out. Although undoubtedly a fearsome sorceress more than capable of defeating her enemies by herself, the Fay Enchantress is served by her loyal body of Grail Knights, whose lives are sworn to protect her person and obey any and all commands. She is also served by the Damsels and Prophetesses of the Lady, who are called into her service as children and become her acolytes, eventually having not insignificant magical powers of their own."

On the battlefield, she uses magic to both protect Bretonnian forces from attack or weaken and strike down the foe – sometimes with a single, furious stare!"

From his capital at Couronne, the King rules wisely and with an even-hand when dealing with Knight or noble alike. Fairness in all matters is his watchword, never allowing the law as written to compromise its noble intent, never refusing anyone – peasants excepted of course – a hearing in his presence to air grievances of which he must be the judge. So great is Louen’s statecraft and mastery of diplomacy that many consider him to be not just the natural successor of Gilles the Uniter, but believe he is descended from the same noble bloodline."

Somehow, the King has halted the aging process, appearing to be a much younger man than his birth records belie; maybe it is the Lady’s favour, her eternal blessings – or even her ethereal kiss – that enables Louen to hold back the advancing years and continue to lead his kingdom to glory? For glory is at hand – the time has come for Bretonnians to rally under King Louen’s banner and, with the blessing of the Lady and the protection of the Fay Enchantress, march on dark, corrupted Mousillon and bring it back under control once and for all!"

If Man and the other races of the so-called civilised lands of the south were so keen to fight him and his bestial subjects, then fight them he would.

In Grombrindal’s case, turns out he can do quite a lot; the White Dwarf is a mighty warrior, some say bettered only by Grimnir himself. Every slash of his legendary axe sees the heads of urks tumble from their dishonourable shoulders. Grombrindal has faced armies of thousands on his own and won, which is why many believe him to be a living Ancestor."

Thorgrim is forever brooding upon how to return his people to their former glory. As the ultimate ruler of the Dwarfs, the Great Book of Grudges is entrusted into his keeping. It is Thorgrim’s avowed wish to avenge every single entry contained in that voluminous tome. Such is his resolve that he has already rejuvenated the Karaz Ankor. Tales of his deeds, and the long list of grudges already struck out, fill his grim warriors with the feeling that the Dwarfs have long done without: hope. A new age of retribution has begun."

Somehow he survived, and from that day on he has only ever been seen swathed in shimmering, metallic robes and wearing a golden face mask. Some say that beneath his mask his skin has turned to pure gold, while others whisper that he is horribly disfigured, though the truth of the matter is known only to Balthasar. One thing is certain: the accident only furthered his will to succeed, and this determination increased his powers to new heights. With a single gesture, Balthasar Gelt can transform his enemies into lifeless golden statues or turn their bones into molten iron. With such power at his command, Balthasar has secured victory for the Empire on numerous occasions."

If a single day went by without a battle, Grimgor was known to start camp-decimating arguments, his one good eye blazing with eagerness to find fault and start a good scrap. Two days without a battle and Grimgor would smite anything he could reach, save (perhaps) his fellow Black Orcs. Who knows what would happen if three days without a battle ever occurred? Even scarred veterans tremble just to think of it. This unquenchable thirst for battle is a sign that marks out a Warboss for leadership, a sign that the Orc is favoured by Gork. In a hulking Black Orc with unmatched fighting skills and ferocity, it has marked out Grimgor for greatness; the prophet and harbinger of Gork."

Although he tried to resist her requests to taste the Blood Kiss, to be made Unliving, the terrible, wasting disease that threatened to kill his coldly-beautiful new wife forced his hand. Realising that he could not continue without her, Vlad gave the dying Isabella what she desired and inducted her into the Midnight Aristocracy’s nefarious ranks."

She sups it constantly, even in the cut and thrust of the fray – the blood healing her wounds almost instantly and confounding her opponents just long enough for the killing blow to be struck!"

A few had perhaps amassed small forces and carved out far-flung domains, but it was Vlad’s usurpation of Sylvania and legitimate gaining of the title of Count that marked a new era of bloodshed. When he revealed his true intentions to the rest of the Empire, two hundred years after his arrival in that cursed region, he waged war in order to become Emperor - for he truly believed he had a legitimate claim to the throne. It has since become a burning desire of all his bloodline, who feel - righteously or not - that they should become Emperor, for is it not right that the farmer herds the cattle? Vlad has been thwarted in his quest on a few occasions, but has always managed to find a way back to Unlife. Now he has risen yet again – and his desire to conquer the mortal fools is as strong as ever!"
